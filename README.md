---

### Use it, no cap:
You're free to use this code however you vibe with it. No tea, no shade. Build rockets, automate memes, or teach your cat to code—no rules, no judgment, no cap. Just don’t sue me if your toaster starts demanding snacks.

---

### Remix it, stay lit:
Feel free to tweak, flip, or completely overhaul this chaotic masterpiece. Add sprinkles, remove bugs, or turn it into a haiku generator—it’s all good. Just promise not to come crying if your computer starts speaking in binary poetry.

---

### Share the love, fam:
Spread the code far and wide, fam! If you redistribute it, please include attribution to the original creator (if known). Bonus points if you add a funny comment or two. Sharing is caring, but don’t be shady about it.

---

### No warranty, deal with it:
This code has **no warranty**, periodt. If it glitches, explodes, or accidentally hacks NASA, that’s on you. Not me. Never me. Two broken pieces = one whole problem.

---

### Copyright? Nah, we're all about that open-source life / More like CopyLOL:
This code belongs to everyone now. It’s like finding a stray meme online—it’s too wild to be owned by anyone. So go ahead, yeet it into the void and let the universe decide its fate.
