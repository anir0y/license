### **FML [Funny meme License] 2.0**
#### License: *Yeet It Into the Void*
Use it, no cap: You can use this code for whatever floats your boat (or sinks it). No strings attached—unless you count the spaghetti code holding everything together.

Modify it, stay based: Feel free to tweak, twist, or completely overhaul this chaotic masterpiece. Just don’t come crying to me if your laptop starts whispering sweet binary nothings in the middle of the night.

Distribute like a legend: Share this code far and wide, but remember: with great power comes zero responsibility. Don’t be shady about it though—if you share, give credit where it’s due. Or don’t. I’m not your mom.

No warranty, periodt: This code is provided “as-is,” which means if it breaks, glitches, or accidentally summons Cthulhu, you’re on your own. Two broken pieces = one whole problem.

Copyright? LOL, nah: If memes had owners, we’d all be broke from royalties. Consider this public domain—or at least as close as something can get without lawyers showing up.

### **Gen Z Vibe Check License**
#### License: *Certified Clapback-Free*
Use it, no tea spilled: Do what you want with this code. Whether you’re building a rocket ship or just trying to make toast, go off, queen/king/non-binary royalty.

Remix it, stay iconic: Tweak it, flip it, reverse it—just keep the energy alive. Bonus points if you add extra drip. Extra penalties if you turn it into cringe.

Spread the vibes, fam: Pass this code along, but keep it real. If you’re gonna share, do it right. No half measures, no Karen energy. Keep it authentic, keep it lit.

No warranty, deal with it: This code has exactly **zero** guarantees. If it explodes, implodes, or turns your screen into hieroglyphics, that’s on you. Not me. Never me.

Open-source life, always: Copyright? That’s so last season. This code belongs to everyone now. Think of it as a digital potluck—grab a plate, enjoy the chaos, and maybe bring something back to share.
